            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> in a Parliamentary way, wee muſt withdraw and enter into our owne Spheare. Enter into a diſcuſſe of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that impugne Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerralds</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, admittance and priviledge of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt that uſhers in the traine, is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence cloathed in ſable, ſtanding on tip-toe, and with a ruſtie dagger thruſting at a ſtarre, I meane a ſentence ſpeaking error, a ſentence vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the third and fourth generation, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſtriving to leap over the bounds of <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na charta,</hi> thirty times confirmed, a ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded againſt a <hi>Judge</hi> of a higher Court, then from which it iſſued. The cauſe in queſtion is to nullifie this ſentence, which if hee appeare a perſon capable of his priviledge, <hi>mote ſua vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> and then neither it, nor any thing deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or collater all to it, may bee admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by the rules of common, civill, or cannon Law, it being a maxime conſonant to them all. <hi>Non potes edduci ejuſdam rei excepie cujus petitur diſſolutio.</hi> Now to prove this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence void (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I being no profeſſour of the Law, yet a Diſciple of reaſon, and the body of the audient Subject to the like

All judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, cenſures, ſentences, &amp;c. awarded againſt a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament are void, ſo was this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſome may ſay, the King is not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, I ſay <hi>(qui dicit omne, excludit nullum)</hi> And experience, the mother of know ledge, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the ſame in precedents afore rehearſed, and one J will adde for all, which is <hi>Trewman,</hi> 38. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who was in execution upon a writ of exigent after <hi>a Capias adſatis faciend.</hi> at the Kings ſuite, and yet priviledged, beſides, this is not at the Kings ſuite, for the King is intereſſed here but ſecondarily both in name and profit. Now I muſt make good my minor, that he is a member of this houſe: hee that was duly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and truely returned, is a member of this houſe, ſo was he. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> My minor will be queſtioned, J confirme it thus, where the Kings writ for election is duely purſued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt vſed and received forme, there ſuch an election is good, ſo was this. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Here (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) falls the weight of their objection, which we will maſter, and anſwer with equall ſpeede, and firſt <hi>vellicat mihi aureum neſcio quis,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130512:12"/>ſayes the writ is <hi>Burgenſide Burgo,</hi> but he is not <hi>Burgenſis de Burgo.</hi> Firſt I ſay <hi>quomodo conſtat,</hi> here is none to offer in proofe he is not ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I offer it in Quaere, whether the election doth not <hi>ipſo facto</hi> make him a Burgeſſe, <hi>&amp; in omni inſtanti,</hi> againe I ſay the writ is <hi>directive</hi> not <hi>poſitive. v.g. in a venire facias,</hi> the Sheriffe commanded to returne 12. yet if hee returne not 24. he ſhall be fined, in reſpect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and practice proves, ſome of the 12. may be queſtioned and challenged: beſides the writ explains it ſelfe, the Knights muſt be <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus tui,</hi> but the Burgeſſes and Citizens <hi>dequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libit Civitate</hi> &amp; <hi>Burgo,</hi> which can admit of no other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction, but theſe two Burgeſſes out of every Burrough (&amp; not as <hi>Comitattus tui,</hi> is, which were then of every Burrough, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Law provided this with great reaſon as not doubting every Sheere could afford <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knights, <hi>reſident, yet jealous,</hi> whether every bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough could provide 2. reſident Burgeſſes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with theſe neceſſary adju<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cts, as could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a member of ſo noble a place; Againe the writ commands <hi>duos milites,</hi> and yet excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was never take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon retorning of Eſquires, ſo that the writ expounds it ſelfe, it is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally to be taken. Next there is Thunder and Lightning ſhot out of the Statute, 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Stat. to regulate election, and abſolutely commanding every Knight and Burgeſſe to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:130512:12"/>reſident and have a certaine Fee-ſimple in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very burrough and County, our of which they are elected; Here they ſuppoſe our Priviledge will cry quarter as ready to be murtherd by the Statute, but it is <hi>ominous ante victoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> For firſt, we anſwer, that the diſuſe of a Statute antiquates a Statute, as is obſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> and cuſtome applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by fortunate experience hath in all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ever prevailed; a houſe of Commons would rather preſent <hi>Babell</hi> in it's confuſion, if the <hi>Tincker</hi> would ſpeake his <hi>Dialect,</hi> the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler his, and the Butcher conclude a greaſie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilogue, then the writ were well purſued, theſe were <hi>J donei homines</hi> to take &amp; give counſell <hi>de rebus arduis;</hi> but even to cut off the head of their owne argument by a Sword of their own, this Stat. of 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſee mes by the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be made in repeale of all former Statuts, by which, election not qualified with reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, was made void, and ſo became a greevance to the Common-wealth, &amp; therefore this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute makes the election not obſerved <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> onely penall, ſo that there is nothing offered in objection, either from the writ or Statute to avoid this election. Now I have placed him &amp; daily elected him, and then his priviledge growes by conſequence, but yet we have other objections <hi>minoris magnitudinis,</hi> &amp; to repeate them is to confute them; Firſt ſay they eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130512:13"/>
               <hi>Libelleris, de jure,</hi> exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated; J anſwer, every <hi>Libeller</hi> muſt be <hi>Scriptis; Pictis,</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilenis,</hi> our member is guilty of none of them, no, he is not termed, ſo neither in the cenſure, nor in any preſent proceeding. Another flouriſh is, that hee pleaded not his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in the <hi>Caſtle-Chamber,</hi> in which very objection, they confeſſe him priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and make themſelves guilty, that they would proceed againſt a knowne member of our Houſe. But ſee the Roman Spirit of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> who would rather undergoe the hazard of being a <hi>Starre-chamber Martyr,</hi> then to ſubmit our Priviledge to an extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall debate. It was in our honour hee did this, and for his eternall applauſe: ſome body ſayes the caſtle chamber will thinke it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, there being Lords of the houſe of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament at &amp; in the cenſure. As for the Lords, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum eſt errare,</hi> but the Iudges are rather involved in theſe words <hi>Prameditata militia,</hi> for his election was the 11. of <hi>November</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the in Parliament; and his cenſure the 13. of <hi>December,</hi> ſo they had 22. or 23. dayes to repent of their ill-grounded reſolution, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affront never offered to the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, being comparative, as if the Recorder of the <hi>Tolſell</hi> ſhould ſentence the Lord chiefe Juſtice of <hi>Ireland</hi> a member of our houſe is a walking Record: &amp; needs not to melt the Kings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:130512:13"/>picture in his pocket. Others alledge, it was an election purchaſed by colluſion, but <hi>de non exiſtentibus &amp; non apparentib. eadem eſt ratio.</hi> And ſince the end of his election is in it ſelfe and <hi>per-ſe,</hi> for the advancing of the publicke ſervice, as well as to prove a ſentence not then <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> both Law and charity in a benigne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction of theſe 2. ends will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the more favourable. Another objection is whiſpered, that the entrance is not found in the Clerke of the Parliaments Role; This is no matter to the validity of his election, for his Priviledge commenced 40. dayes before the Parliament, therefore this and the like are to be judged of as <hi>accidentia quae poſsunt abeſſe &amp; adeſſe ſine ſubjecti interitu.</hi> Truely (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) my memory and lungs begin to prove Traitors to me; Another objection, if omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be judged by theſe of what ſtrength and maturity they, even as by the coynage of a penny, one may judge of a ſhilling; What hinders then, ſince here is water but, that hee may be baptized? Here are no <hi>non obſtant's</hi> to be admitted in his new Pattent of Denization, the common law, the Statute law, the Canon, the Civill Law plead for his admittance, the writ of election, the exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plification of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes returne, all preſidents of all ages, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports plead for his admittance, our fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ghoſts, the preſent practice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>England</hi> plead for his admittance,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130512:14"/>the Kings ſucceſſive commands, command and confirme his admittance; Away then Serjeant and with the hazarding power of our Mace touch the Marſhals gates, and (as if there were Divinity in it) they will open and bring us our Olive branch of peace wreſted from our ſtock, that with welcome Art we may ingraft him to be nouriſhed by a common roote. Thus the King ſhall receive the benefit of an able Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who is otherwiſe, <hi>Civiliter mortuus,</hi> we enjoy the participation of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and poſterity both ours and this.</p>
